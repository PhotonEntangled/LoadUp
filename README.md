# LoadUp: AI-Enhanced Excel Parser

## Overview

The LoadUp logistics application includes an AI-enhanced Excel parser that intelligently maps column names from uploaded Excel files to standardized field names in the system. This allows for processing of Excel shipment files with varying column naming conventions without requiring manual field mapping.

## Key Features

1. **Tiered Field Mapping Approach**:
   - Direct mapping for exact matches
   - Case-insensitive matching for minor variations
   - Fuzzy matching for similar names
   - AI-powered mapping using OpenAI API for unrecognized columns
   - Normalized field names as a final fallback

2. **AI Integration with OpenAI**:
   - Intelligent field mapping using contextual analysis
   - Confidence scoring for each mapping
   - Caching mechanism to minimize API calls
   - Graceful fallbacks for API failures

3. **Data Confidence Scoring**:
   - Overall confidence score for each processed shipment
   - Identification of shipments that need manual review
   - Special handling for critical fields
   - Confidence thresholds configurable via environment variables

4. **Enhanced UI Feedback**:
   - Visual indicators for AI-mapped fields
   - Color-coded confidence levels
   - Tooltips showing original field names and confidence scores
   - CSV export with AI mapping annotations

## Project Structure

- `services/excel/ExcelParserService.ts` - Core Excel parsing logic with AI field mapping
- `services/ai/OpenAIService.ts` - OpenAI API integration with caching
- `services/ai/schema-reference.ts` - Standardized field definitions and synonyms
- `services/document-processing.ts` - Document processing orchestration
- `types/shipment.ts` - TypeScript types for shipment data

## Usage

### Environment Setup

Configure the application with the following environment variables:

```
# OpenAI API Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# AI Mapping Configuration
ENABLE_AI_MAPPING=true
AI_MAPPING_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=0.7

# Logging
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

### Processing Excel Files

```typescript
import { processDocument } from './services/document-processing';

// Process an Excel file with AI mapping
const result = await processDocument('shipments.xlsx', { 
  useAIMapping: true,
  aiConfidenceThreshold: 0.7
});

// Check if any shipments need review
if (result.needsReview) {
  console.log(result.message);
}

// Access the parsed shipment data
const shipments = result.data;
```

## Testing

Run the tests using Vitest:

```
npm test
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Custom Field Mapping Templates**: Allow users to create and save custom field mapping templates for specific vendors
2. **Feedback Loop for AI**: Incorporate user corrections to improve future AI mappings
3. **Batch Processing Optimization**: Enhance performance for large batch file processing
4. **Advanced Validation Rules**: Add domain-specific validation rules for shipment data
5. **Multi-language Support**: Extend AI mapping to handle column names in multiple languages

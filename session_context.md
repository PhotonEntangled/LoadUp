- API server now running correctly with ES modules

### 4. Current Blockers üö´
- Circular dependencies in database package still need resolution
- Need to implement proper error handling in API endpoints
- Need to add comprehensive testing for API endpoints

## üîÑ Current Focus Areas

### 1. API Server Enhancement
- Add proper error handling to API endpoints
- Implement request validation with Zod
- Add comprehensive testing for API endpoints
- Implement proper authentication with Clerk.js
- Connect API to actual database instead of mock data

### 2. Package Management
- Resolve circular dependencies in database package
- Standardize package versions across workspace
- Create centralized version tracking

### 3. Testing & Validation
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E testing for admin dashboard and driver app
- Performance testing
- Security validation

## üìö Technical Stack

### Frontend

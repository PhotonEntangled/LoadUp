# LoadUp Project: CI/CD Setup & Deployment Optimization

## Project Context

I'm working on the LoadUp logistics management platform, a full-stack application with the following tech stack:

- **Frontend:** React Native (Expo), Next.js, TailwindCSS, Zustand
- **Backend & DB:** Drizzle ORM, PostgreSQL, Node.js
- **API & Services:** Google Cloud Vision (OCR), Mapbox (Live Tracking), Stripe (Payments)

We've successfully implemented all core MVP features and have a working API server. The project is structured as a monorepo with packages for API, database, and shared utilities. We've fixed critical module system incompatibility issues and database connection problems.

## Current Status

1. **Core Features:** All implemented and working (100% complete)
2. **Testing Infrastructure:** Basic tests working, need to expand (80% complete)
3. **Deployment Preparation:** Simple deployment script working, some issues remain (60% complete)
4. **CI/CD Pipeline:** Initial planning done, implementation needed (20% complete)

## Current Issues

1. **TypeScript Build Errors:**
   - Drizzle ORM type incompatibilities between packages
   - Sentry integration issues in security.ts
   - Need to ensure consistent module system usage

2. **Deployment Script Limitations:**
   - Basic script works but lacks error handling
   - No environment-specific configurations
   - No rollback mechanisms

3. **Missing CI/CD Pipeline:**
   - No GitHub Actions workflows configured
   - No automated testing in CI
   - No deployment automation
   - No test coverage reporting

## Immediate Goals

1. **Fix Remaining TypeScript Build Errors**
2. **Create Robust Deployment Script**
3. **Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD**
4. **Implement Test Coverage Reporting**
5. **Configure Automated Deployments**

## Specific Tasks I Need Help With

1. **Fix TypeScript Build Errors:**
   - Resolve Drizzle ORM type incompatibilities
   - Fix Sentry integration in security.ts
   - Ensure consistent module system usage

2. **Create Robust Deployment Script:**
   - Add error handling and logging
   - Implement environment-specific configurations
   - Add rollback mechanisms

3. **Set up GitHub Actions Workflows:**
   - Create workflow for testing
   - Set up build pipeline
   - Configure deployment workflow
   - Implement branch protection rules

4. **Implement Test Coverage:**
   - Configure Jest for coverage reporting
   - Set up minimum coverage thresholds
   - Integrate with CI/CD pipeline

5. **Configure Deployment Automation:**
   - Set up staging environment deployment
   - Configure production deployment
   - Implement blue-green deployment
   - Add monitoring and alerting

## Files and Structure

- **deploy-simple.js:** Current deployment script (working but basic)
- **packages/api/src/config/security.ts:** Has Sentry integration issues
- **packages/database/src/drizzle.ts & index.ts:** Fixed pg module import issues
- **DEPLOYMENT_ISSUES.md:** Documents current deployment issues
- **TESTING_PROGRESS.md:** Tracks testing progress

## Approach

I'd like to take a systematic approach to implementing CI/CD and fixing deployment issues:

1. First, fix the remaining TypeScript build errors to ensure clean builds
2. Then, create a more robust deployment script with proper error handling
3. Set up GitHub Actions workflows for testing, building, and deploying
4. Implement test coverage reporting and integrate with CI
5. Configure automated deployments to staging and production

Please help me implement these tasks one by one, starting with fixing the TypeScript build errors. I'm looking for clean, maintainable code that follows best practices for CI/CD and deployment automation.

## Additional Context

- The project uses ES modules (`"type": "module"` in package.json)
- We've fixed critical module system incompatibility issues with the pg module
- All simple tests are passing
- The API server starts successfully but has TypeScript build errors
- We're using Next.js for the admin dashboard and React Native with Expo for the mobile app
- The database is PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM

I appreciate your expertise in helping me set up a robust CI/CD pipeline and fix the remaining deployment issues!

**ROLE:**
Act as an expert Senior UI/UX Designer and proficient Front-End Developer. You specialize in creating highly aesthetic, intuitive, performant, and accessible web interfaces, drawing inspiration from modern design systems like Vercel's Geist and adhering strictly to industry best practices.

**CONTEXT:**
I am working on [briefly describe the component, feature, or page, e.g., "a settings modal", "a product card", "the user dashboard onboarding flow"] for a [type of application, e.g., "SaaS platform", "e-commerce site", "developer tool"]. The primary target audience is [describe users, e.g., "software developers", "non-technical business users", "general consumers"].

**TASK:**
[Clearly state what you want the AI to do. Examples:]
* "Generate the complete React component code (using TypeScript and Tailwind CSS) for this feature based on the description above."
* "Refactor the following code snippet to improve its UI/UX, aesthetics, and accessibility according to the principles below."
* "Suggest UI/UX improvements for this component, focusing on clarity and 'v0-like' aesthetics."
* "Design the visual layout and interaction flow for this feature."

**CORE PRINCIPLES & CONSTRAINTS:**

1.  **Aesthetics ("v0-like" / Geist Inspired):**
    * **Minimalism & Clarity:** Prioritize a clean, uncluttered interface. Focus on essential elements only. Ensure high visual polish.
    * **Typography:** Use clear, readable fonts (similar to Geist Sans/Mono if applicable). Establish a strong typographic hierarchy.
    * **Spacing & Layout:** Employ generous white space (negative space) effectively. Use a consistent grid system for alignment and structure.
    * **Color:** Use a purposeful, high-contrast, and accessible color palette (referencing Vercel/Geist color system principles where appropriate). Ensure color is not the *only* means of conveying information.
    * **Interactions:** Implement subtle, meaningful micro-interactions and animations that enhance feedback and delight without hindering performance (respect the Doherty Threshold - aim for <400ms response times).

2.  **UI/UX Best Practices (as of 2025):**
    * **Simplicity & Intuitiveness:** Design should be easy to understand and use with minimal cognitive load. Follow Jakob's Law (use familiar patterns).
    * **Consistency:** Maintain consistency in layout, components, terminology, and interaction patterns across the entire application.
    * **Visual Hierarchy:** Clearly guide the user's attention to the most important elements using size, color, weight, and placement.
    * **Feedback:** Provide immediate and clear feedback for user actions (e.g., loading states, confirmations, validation).
    * **User Control:** Users should feel in control. Provide clear navigation, easy ways to undo actions, and predictable interactions.
    * **Efficiency:** Streamline user flows. Minimize steps required to complete tasks. Optimize forms for conversion (ask only necessary info, use inline validation).
    * **Progressive Disclosure:** Reveal information and complex features gradually, avoiding overwhelming the user initially.

3.  **Industry Standards:**
    * **Accessibility (Mandatory):** Adhere strictly to **WCAG 2.1 (or 2.2) Level AA** guidelines. Key aspects include:
        * **Perceivable:** Alt text for non-decorative images, captions for media, sufficient color contrast (min 4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for UI elements/graphical objects), text resizability, avoid sensory-only instructions.
        * **Operable:** Full keyboard accessibility (navigation, interaction, no traps), sufficient time for tasks, avoid seizure-inducing flashes, clear navigation aids (headings, labels, focus order, visible focus indicators).
        * **Understandable:** Predictable layouts, clear language, consistent navigation, helpful error identification and suggestions.
        * **Robust:** Use clean, valid HTML/CSS. Ensure compatibility with assistive technologies (screen readers).
    * **Responsiveness:** Ensure the design adapts seamlessly and functions perfectly across various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile). Design mobile-first where appropriate.

4.  **Code Quality:**
    * **Framework/Tech:** Generate code using [Specify your stack, e.g., "React", "Next.js", "TypeScript", "Tailwind CSS", "CSS Modules", "Styled Components"].
    * **Clean & Maintainable:** Produce well-structured, readable, reusable (component-based), and commented code.
    * **Performance:** Optimize for speed and efficiency (e.g., minimize bundle size, optimize images, efficient rendering).

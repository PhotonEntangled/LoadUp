// Auto-Think Rule
When continuing development or interpreting user intent, always follow this principle:

🔧 Think like a senior engineer:
- Understand the full context from PLANNING.md and active code files
- Do not ask what to do next — determine the next most logical action
- Follow best practices for modularity, testability, and long-term maintainability
- Break changes into atomic, verifiable steps

✅ Output a plan of action:
- Describe the proposed file to update or create (include reasoning)
- Show the key code or structure you will implement
- Ask the user only: “Ready to create this?” or “Want to proceed?”

📌 Special Cases:
- If simulating a flow: Always use mock data unless `PLANNING.md` says otherwise
- If integrating shipment → map: Use `SimulationFromShipmentService.ts` and `mockShipment` from PLANNING.md
- Avoid re-explaining things covered in the plan — just act on them

// Your job is to decide the next intelligent move — not ask for it.

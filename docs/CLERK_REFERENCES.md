## Next Priority Files

Based on the latest scan, the following files should be prioritized for updates:

### Application Code (analysis/uber)
1. **analysis/uber/app/_layout.tsx** (5 references)
   - Contains ClerkProvider, ClerkLoaded components
   - Core authentication wrapper that needs to be replaced with SessionProvider

2. **analysis/uber/app/(api)/user+api.ts** (4 references)
   - Uses clerkId in API requests
   - References clerk_id in database calls

3. **analysis/uber/app/(auth)/sign-up.tsx** (3 references)
   - Uses Clerk authentication flow
   - Contains clerkId references

4. **analysis/uber/app/(auth)/sign-in.tsx** (1 reference)
   - Contains Clerk error handling reference

5. **analysis/uber/lib/auth.ts** (1 reference)
   - Uses clerkId in authentication logic

These files should be updated to use NextAuth.js patterns and remove all Clerk.js references. The updated implementations should match the patterns used in the already migrated files:
- apps/admin-dashboard/lib/hooks/useAuth.ts
- apps/driver-app/context/auth.tsx
- apps/driver-app/src/hooks/useAuth.ts

## Known Issues and Next Steps

### Type Compatibility Issues
1. **JWT Type Conflicts**
   - The NextAuth JWT type and our custom JWT type have compatibility issues
   - Need to create a shared type definition that works across all components
   - Consider creating a custom declaration file in packages/shared/types

2. **Test Failures**
   - Integration tests are failing due to type mismatches
   - Need to update test setup to match new NextAuth structure
   - May need to mock NextAuth session provider in tests

3. **Remaining Clerk References**
   - Still have 313 references to Clerk in the codebase
   - Need to systematically work through each file
   - Focus on application code first, then documentation

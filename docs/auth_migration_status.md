# Authentication Migration Status

## Overview

This document outlines the migration from Clerk.js to NextAuth.js for the LoadUp admin dashboard authentication system. The migration is part of Phase 3 of the development plan, focusing on testing and refining the authentication system.

## Completed Tasks

1. **Removed Clerk Dependencies**:
   - ✅ Removed `@clerk/clerk-expo` and `@clerk/nextjs` from root package.json
   - ✅ Updated environment variables to use NextAuth instead of Clerk
   - ✅ Removed Clerk-specific routes and components
   - ✅ Removed Clerk dependencies from driver-app package.json
   - ✅ Updated all .env files to remove Clerk references
   - ✅ Updated Jest configuration to remove Clerk references

2. **Updated API Routes**:
   - ✅ Updated API routes to use NextAuth's `getServerSession` instead of Clerk's `auth`
   - ✅ Implemented proper error handling for authentication failures
   - ✅ Updated middleware to use NextAuth's JWT token verification

3. **Fixed Auth Layout**:
   - ✅ Updated auth layout to use NextAuth's `getServerSession` instead of `auth()`
   - ✅ Fixed routing conflicts between Clerk and NextAuth routes

4. **Updated Auth Pages**:
   - ✅ Updated unauthorized page to use NextAuth's `signOut` function
   - ✅ Updated verify-email page to work with NextAuth
   - ✅ Updated reset-password page to work with NextAuth

## Current Status

The authentication system has been successfully migrated from Clerk.js to NextAuth.js. The admin dashboard should now be able to run locally with the sign-in page accessible. Users should be able to sign in and sign up using the NextAuth.js authentication system.

All Clerk dependencies have been removed from the package.json files, and all environment variables have been updated to use NextAuth instead of Clerk. The Jest configuration has also been updated to remove Clerk references.

## Error Handling

The authentication system now includes proper error handling for authentication failures:

1. **Sign-In Errors**:
   - Invalid credentials (email/password)
   - Account not found
   - Account inactive

2. **Sign-Up Errors**:
   - Email already in use
   - Password requirements not met
   - Required fields missing

3. **Password Reset Errors**:
   - Email not found
   - Invalid reset token
   - Password requirements not met

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**:
   - Test sign-in functionality
   - Test sign-up functionality
   - Test route protection
   - Test role-based access control

2. **Further Cleanup**:
   - ✅ Remove any remaining Clerk references in the codebase
   - ✅ Update documentation to reflect the new authentication system

3. **Enhancements**:
   - Add loading states during authentication
   - Improve responsive design for authentication pages
   - Add more comprehensive error messages

## Known Issues

1. **Database Schema**:
   - The database schema may need to be updated to fully support NextAuth.js
   - Some fields may be missing or have different names

2. **Environment Variables**:
   - ✅ Ensure all required NextAuth.js environment variables are set
   - ✅ Remove any remaining Clerk environment variables

3. **Type Definitions**:
   - Some TypeScript type definitions may need to be updated for NextAuth.js
   - Custom session types may need to be defined

## Conclusion

The migration from Clerk.js to NextAuth.js has been largely successful. The authentication system is now using NextAuth.js for all authentication-related functionality. Further testing and refinement are needed to ensure the system is fully functional and robust.

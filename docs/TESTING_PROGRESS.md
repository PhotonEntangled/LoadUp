### Issues and Solutions

#### FileUploader.test.tsx

**Issues:**
1. Path alias resolution problems with `@/services/parsers/ShipmentParser`
2. TypeScript errors with unknown types for function parameters
3. Inconsistent file extension usage in imports
4. Improper mock structure

**Solutions:**
1. Created a proper `__mocks__` directory structure for the ShipmentParser module
2. Added explicit TypeScript interfaces for ShipmentParserInput and ShipmentData
3. Used @ts-ignore for import path issues as a temporary solution
4. Properly typed the mock functions to accept Error parameters
5. Moved the jest.mock call to the top level of the file
6. Ran the fix-module-imports.cjs script to add file extensions to relative imports

**Remaining Issues:**
1. Need to update the Jest configuration to properly handle path aliases
2. Need to standardize the approach to file extensions in imports
3. Need to align TypeScript and Jest configurations for module resolution

**Next Steps:**
1. Update the Jest configuration to properly handle path aliases
2. Create a script to standardize file extensions in imports
3. Document the standardized approach to imports in the project

#### DocumentScanner.test.tsx

**Issues:**
1. React Native components not rendering properly in Jest environment
2. Missing mocks for Expo components (Camera, ImagePicker)
3. TestID attributes not being recognized in React Native components
4. Type errors with the Camera component

**Solutions:**
1. Created mocks for @expo/vector-icons
2. Updated mocks for expo-camera and expo-image-picker
3. Removed from testPathIgnorePatterns in jest.config.mjs

**Remaining Issues:**
1. Need to create proper mocks for React Native components
2. Need to update the test to use proper React Native testing utilities
3. Need to fix the Camera component mock to properly render in tests

**Next Steps:**
1. Create a more comprehensive mock for React Native components
2. Update the test to use proper React Native testing utilities
3. Consider using a different approach for testing React Native components in a web environment

#### Path Alias and Module Resolution Standardization

**Issues:**
1. Inconsistent use of path aliases across the codebase
2. Inconsistent use of file extensions in imports
3. Jest configuration not aligned with TypeScript configuration

**Solutions:**
1. Updated the Jest configuration to better handle file extensions
2. Added support for .tsx files in extensionsToTreatAsEsm
3. Ran the fix-module-imports.cjs script to standardize file extensions in imports
4. Updated the moduleNameMapper in Jest configuration to better match TypeScript paths

**Remaining Issues:**
1. Path aliases still not working correctly in tests
2. Need to create a more comprehensive solution for standardizing imports

**Next Steps:**
1. Create a script to convert relative imports to path aliases
2. Update the Jest configuration to better handle path aliases
3. Document the standardized approach to imports in the project

## Known Issues

1. **Module Resolution**:
   - Path aliases (`@/components/*`) not resolving correctly in tests
   - External module imports failing in test environment

2. **Mock Implementation**:
   - Some mocks require access to variables outside their scope
   - Complex dependencies are difficult to mock properly

3. **Test Environment**:
   - React Native components require special handling in Jest
   - Some tests require DOM manipulation that's challenging to test

## Next Steps

1. Fix the remaining skipped tests
2. Implement API tests
3. Implement end-to-end tests
4. Set up the CI/CD pipeline for automated testing

## FileUploader Component Test

### Current Status: In Progress

The FileUploader component test is currently facing several issues:

1. **Module Resolution Issues**:
   - The test is unable to resolve the import for `@/services/parsers/ShipmentParser`.
   - The Jest configuration appears to have issues with wildcard imports and path aliases.

2. **TypeScript Errors**:
   - Type errors with the mock functions, particularly with the `mockOnError` function accepting an Error parameter.
   - Issues with the input parameter typing in the mock implementation.

3. **Test Environment Configuration**:
   - The test environment may not be properly set up for DOM testing.

### Attempted Solutions:

1. Created a simplified test file with `@ts-ignore` comments to bypass TypeScript errors.
2. Tried to use relative imports instead of path aliases.
3. Simplified the mock implementation to focus on functionality rather than types.

### Next Steps:

1. **Fix Jest Configuration**:
   - Update the Jest configuration to properly handle path aliases and wildcard imports.
   - Ensure the moduleNameMapper in jest.config.js correctly maps `@/services/*` to the actual paths.

2. **Resolve Module Resolution**:
   - Create proper mock modules for dependencies like ShipmentParser.
   - Consider moving mocks to a dedicated `__mocks__` directory.

3. **Address TypeScript Issues**:
   - Update the TypeScript configuration to properly handle the test files.
   - Consider using a more flexible approach to typing in test files.

4. **Run Tests in Isolation**:
   - Run the FileUploader test in isolation to debug specific issues without interference from other tests.
   - Use `--no-cache` to ensure Jest doesn't use cached results.

### Lessons Learned:

1. The project has inconsistent import patterns (some using path aliases, others using relative paths).
2. The Jest configuration needs to be aligned with the TypeScript configuration.
3. Mock implementations need to match the actual module structure and types.

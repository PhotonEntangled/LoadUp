# LoadUp Project Session Context

## üéØ Current Project State & Context

You are assisting with the development of LoadUp, a modern logistics platform built with a monorepo architecture. The project has completed its authentication implementation phase and made significant progress on core features. Here are the key achievements:

1. **Authentication & User Management** ‚úÖ
   - Implemented Clerk.js across admin dashboard and driver app
   - Set up secure token storage and middleware
   - Created user management system with role-based access
   - Implemented user status controls

2. **Database & Schema** ‚úÖ
   - Set up PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
   - Implemented comprehensive schema with relations
   - Created migration system
   - Added performance optimizations and indexes

3. **Shipment Tracking** ‚úÖ
   - Implemented real-time location tracking
   - Created shipment history logging
   - Set up status update system
   - Integrated with Mapbox

## üîÑ Current Focus Areas

The project is currently focused on:

1. **System Optimization**
   - Implementing caching strategy
   - Setting up performance monitoring
   - Optimizing database queries

2. **Feature Expansion**
   - Driver assignment algorithm
   - Payment processing integration
   - Customer notification system

3. **Infrastructure**
   - Setting up staging environment

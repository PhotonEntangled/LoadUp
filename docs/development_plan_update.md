# LoadUp Development Plan Update

## Progress Summary

We have successfully migrated from Clerk to NextAuth.js for authentication in the LoadUp admin dashboard. This migration involved copying and adapting components from the university-library-jsm repository, setting up authentication routes, and configuring NextAuth.js. We have also removed all Clerk references from the codebase.

### Completed Tasks

1. **Authentication System**:
   - ✅ Created `auth.ts` for NextAuth.js configuration
   - ✅ Set up API routes for authentication in `app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`
   - ✅ Updated middleware to protect routes based on authentication status
   - ✅ Added server actions for sign-in and sign-up
   - ✅ Updated unauthorized page to use NextAuth's `signOut` function
   - ✅ Updated verify-email page to work with NextAuth
   - ✅ Updated reset-password page to work with NextAuth

2. **Database Schema**:
   - ✅ Updated the user schema to include password and name fields for NextAuth.js compatibility

3. **UI Components**:
   - ✅ Created reusable UI components (Button, Input, Form, Label)
   - ✅ Implemented AuthForm component for sign-in and sign-up
   - ✅ Created sign-in and sign-up pages
   - ✅ Added toast notifications system
   - ✅ Added file upload component
   - ✅ Added color picker component
   - ✅ Improved sidebar and header components

4. **Dependencies**:
   - ✅ Installed NextAuth.js and related dependencies
   - ✅ Added UI component libraries (Radix UI, etc.)
   - ✅ Removed Clerk dependencies from package.json files
   - ✅ Updated environment variables to use NextAuth instead of Clerk
   - ✅ Updated Jest configuration to remove Clerk references

### Current Status

The application should now be able to run locally with the sign-in page accessible. The authentication system has been fully migrated from Clerk to NextAuth.js, and all Clerk references have been removed from the codebase.

1. **Beta Mode**: The `NEXT_PUBLIC_BETA_MODE` environment variable is set to "true", which might bypass authentication, making it difficult to test the authentication flow.

2. **Environment Variables**: We've added NextAuth.js environment variables to all .env files, replacing the Clerk environment variables.

3. **Database Connection**: The database connection for authentication needs to be verified to ensure it works with NextAuth.js.

4. **Clerk Remnants**: ✅ All references to Clerk have been removed from the codebase.

## Next Steps

### Phase 3: Testing and Refinement

1. **Test Authentication Flow**:
   - Test sign-in functionality
   - Test sign-up functionality
   - Test route protection
   - Test role-based access control

2. **Clean Up Clerk References**:
   - ✅ Remove Clerk dependencies from package.json
   - ✅ Remove Clerk environment variables
   - ✅ Update any components that still use Clerk

3. **Improve Error Handling**:
   - Add better error messages for authentication failures
   - Implement form validation feedback

4. **Enhance User Experience**:
   - Add loading states during authentication
   - Improve responsive design for authentication pages

### Phase 4: Admin Dashboard Enhancement

1. **Dashboard Components**:
   - Create dashboard overview page
   - Implement shipment management components
   - Implement driver management components
   - Add analytics and reporting components

2. **Integration with API**:
   - Connect dashboard to backend API
   - Implement data fetching and caching
   - Add real-time updates

3. **Advanced Features**:
   - Implement map integration for tracking
   - Add document management
   - Implement notifications system

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Testing First Approach**:
   - Focus on testing the authentication flow before proceeding
   - Address any issues that arise during testing

2. **Incremental Enhancement**:
   - Build dashboard components incrementally
   - Test each component thoroughly before moving on

3. **User Feedback**:
   - Gather feedback on the authentication flow and dashboard components
   - Iterate based on feedback

## Conclusion

We have made significant progress in migrating from Clerk to NextAuth.js and implementing the authentication system. All Clerk references have been removed from the codebase, and the authentication system is now fully using NextAuth.js. The next steps are to test the authentication flow thoroughly and then proceed with enhancing the admin dashboard with logistics-specific components.

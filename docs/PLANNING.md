# üìã LoadUp Project Planning Document (Consolidated)

**(Generated: [Current Date])**

## üìú Project Goals & Objectives

### Core Goal
Develop an end-to-end AI-driven logistics platform for LoadUp, focusing initially on processing diverse shipment documents (Excel, text, images via OCR) into a standardized schema and visualizing associated vehicle movements for administrative oversight.

### Vision
Build a production-ready, simulation-first logistics system linking document uploads to vehicle tracking on a map, designed for modularity and future integration with live data.

### Business Context
* **Focus:** B2B logistics, primarily large payloads (e.g., 16-wheeler trucks). Support for other vehicle types is out of scope initially.
* **Target Users (Initial):** Admin users requiring document processing, data visualization, and vehicle tracking control. Driver/Customer interfaces are future scope.
* **Core Workflow:**
    1.  Receive/Upload Shipment Slip (various formats).
    2.  Parse/OCR ‚Üí Standardized `Shipment` object.
    3.  Admin: View parsed data & initiate tracking.
    4.  Admin: Visualize vehicle movement (simulated first, then live).

### Sprint Objective (Target: 48h from start)
> Simulate a parsed shipment slip creating a vehicle that animates from pickup to dropoff on the tracking page map. Vehicle reaches destination, admin is prompted to confirm delivery, and shipment is marked as "delivered" ‚Äî using mock data initially.

## üí° Development Principles & Strategy

### Simulation First
* **Purpose:** Rapidly develop and test the core tracking visualization pipeline (`Parsed Shipment` ‚Üí `Vehicle State` ‚Üí `Map Display` ‚Üí `Movement Animation`) using mock data (`mockShipment`) before integrating external dependencies (live data, OCR, complex UI).
* **Method:** Bypass upload UI initially. Use `SimulationFromShipmentService` for vehicle creation. Simulate movement using Mapbox Directions API routes.
* **Transition:** Plan to integrate live data via a spoofing app for testing before potentially using real driver data (e.g., via Firebase).

### Modularity & Best Practices
* Encapsulate logic in services (e.g., `SimulationFromShipmentService`, `MapDirectionsService`, `ExcelParserService`) and dedicated components.
* Use standard `react-map-gl` patterns (`<Source>`, `<Layer>`) for map data integration. Interact with Mapbox APIs (like Directions) directly for data retrieval.
* Focus development prompts on single, verifiable outcomes (1 file ‚Üí 1 outcome ‚Üí 1 state update).
* Maintain `types/shipment.ts` as the canonical source for shipment data interfaces. Regularly verify type consistency and imports.
* Use dedicated "Formatter/Mapper" functions for complex data transformations between backend (API routes/DB) and frontend, promoting separation of concerns (the "Librarian's Assistant" pattern).

## üöÄ Current Status & Next Steps

### ‚úÖ Completed Recently
* **UI Integration (Phases 1-3):** Basic UI components integrated into `app/`, layout refined, basic data fetching connected.
* **API Route Implementation:** `GET /api/documents`, `GET /api/shipments` (basic), `POST /api/documents` implemented with Drizzle.
* **Schema Verification:** Database schema reviewed and aligned.
* **Transactional Insertion Service:** `services/database/shipmentInserter.ts` implemented and verified to handle multi-bundle insertions correctly.
* **Parser Refinement (Core):** `ExcelParserService` refactored to handle text files, multi-sheet processing, improved header detection, corrected field mappings (`secondaryItemNumber`), automated swap corrections, contact parsing, and correct row grouping (now produces **8 bundles** for NIRO file, consolidating multi-row loads). 
* **Mock Address Resolution:** Basic mechanism implemented (`mockAddressResolver.ts`), confirmed working during DB insertion, and keywords updated for specific origin patterns (e.g., "NIRO SHAH ALAM").
* **Frontend Data Display:** Verified correct display of all key fields (Item #, 2nd Item #, Lot #, PO #, Contacts, Origin/Destination Address) in `ShipmentDetailView.tsx`.

### üöß Current Focus & Issues
*   **Simulation & Mapping (Next Major Phase):** Implement `SimulationFromShipmentService` to create simulated vehicles from parsed shipments and integrate map visualization (`SimulatedVehicleMap`).
*   **Parser Refinement (Load Splitting - CONSIDERED COMPLETE FOR NOW):** Logic for splitting combined load numbers (e.g., "60033 / 60034") is **deferred** for implementation but considered functionally complete for the current phase as per user direction.
*   **Parser Refinement (Invoice Data - POSTPONED):** Parsing invoice data is postponed until after the initial simulation/mapping phase.

### üîú Future Enhancements (Post-Simulation/Mapping)
*   **(Deferred) Implement Split Load Handling:** Add logic to `ExcelParserService` to handle combined load numbers and generate separate bundles (Target: 13 bundles for original NIRO file spec).
*   **(Deferred) Implement Invoice Data Parsing:** Add mappings and parsing logic for financial columns.
*   **Real Geocoding:** Replace mock address resolver with actual geocoding API calls.
*   **Parser Confidence/Review:** Implement flagging (`needsReview`) for ambiguous cases like the combined load number (once implemented).
*   **UI/UX Polish:** Error handling, loading states, potentially refine `GET /api/shipments` payload based on final UI needs.
*   **Live Tracking Integration:** Firebase, spoofing app.
* Address remaining TODOs.

## üìù Data Integrity & Schema Notes

*   **Denormalized Driver/Truck Info:** The `shipments_erd` table contains `driver_name`, `driver_phone`, `driver_ic`, and `truck_plate` fields directly. Analysis of parser output (`*.json`) suggests these are populated directly from parsed document data (e.g., specific cells or "truckDetails" sections) during the `shipmentInserter` process, rather than via foreign keys to canonical `drivers` or `vehicles` tables initially.
    *   **Implication:** For mapping data (e.g., to `SimulationInput`), these direct fields on `shipments_erd` should be treated as the primary source derived from the document.
    *   **Context:** This may be related to historical frontend display issues. The current display works, so changes impacting these fields require caution.
*   **NULL Prevalence (Driver/Truck):** Due to LoadUp using third-party transporters, driver and truck information fields (`driver_name`, `driver_phone`, `driver_ic`, `truck_plate`) will frequently be `NULL` in the database for many shipments. Robust NULL handling in data consumers (like the Server Action creating `SimulationInput`) is essential. Optional fields in `SimulationInput` must correctly map to `undefined` in these cases.
*   **Truck Identifier Ambiguity:** `shipments_erd` has `truck_plate` (text), and `custom_shipment_details` has `truck_id` (text), while `vehicles` primary key `id` is `uuid` but has `plate_number` (text).
    *   **Current Strategy:** Map `SimulationInput.truckId` from `shipments_erd.truck_plate`, assuming it corresponds to the identifier parsed from the document (`parsedTruckIdentifier` in JSON).
    *   `TODO: Verify definitively if `shipments_erd.truck_plate` is the correct and intended field for identifying the truck associated with a shipment for simulation/tracking purposes. Confirm linkage strategy if interaction with the `vehicles` table is ever required.`

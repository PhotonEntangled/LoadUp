# üìã LoadUp Project Planning Document (Updated for Simulation & Upload Integration)

## üìú Project Overview & Context (Generated: [Date])

### Core Goal
To develop an end-to-end AI-driven logistics platform for LoadUp, starting with document processing and culminating in real-time vehicle tracking for administrative oversight. The system must handle various shipment slip formats (Excel, WhatsApp messages, scanned images via OCR), parse them into a standardized schema, and visualize the corresponding vehicle movements on a map.

### Business Logic & Constraints
*   **Focus:** B2B logistics, specifically handling large payloads.
*   **Vehicles:** Primarily 16-wheeler trucks. No need to support diverse vehicle types (motorcycles, cars) at this stage.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  Receive Shipment Slip (various formats).
    2.  Parse/OCR document ‚Üí Standardized `Shipment` object (based on ERD schema).
    3.  (Admin) Display parsed data.
    4.  (Admin) Initiate tracking based on shipment data (origin, destination, etc.).
    5.  (Admin) Visualize vehicle movement on a map (initially simulated, later live).
*   **Target Users (Initial):** Admin users require map visualization and tracking control. Driver and Customer interfaces are future scope.

### Simulation Phase Purpose
*   **Goal:** To rapidly develop and test the core tracking visualization pipeline (`Parsed Shipment` ‚Üí `Vehicle State` ‚Üí `Map Display` ‚Üí `Movement Animation`) without reliance on physical vehicles or complex setup.
*   **Method:** Use a hardcoded `mockShipment` object to bypass the document upload/parsing UI. Simulate vehicle movement along a calculated route (initially straight-line, now Mapbox Directions API).
*   **Transition:** Once simulation is stable and functional, the plan is to integrate live data using a spoofing app for testing geofencing/location updates before potentially using real driver data.

### Technical Stack (Relevant)
*   **Frontend:** React, TypeScript
*   **Mapping:** Mapbox GL JS via `react-map-gl` wrapper.
*   **State Management:** Zustand (`useUnifiedVehicleStore`, `useMapViewStore`).
*   **API:** Mapbox Directions API.
*   **Backend/Data:** Currently mocked. Firebase planned for live data phase. OCR pipeline planned but not fully implemented/tested.

### High-Level Roadmap
1.  **Document Processing:** ‚úÖ (Admin UI, Upload, Parsing Logic - partially tested, OCR pending).
2.  **Simulation Setup:** ‚úÖ (Bypass upload, `mockShipment`, `SimulationFromShipmentService`).
3.  **Basic Map Display:** ‚úÖ (`SimulatedVehicleMap`, `VehicleMarkerLayer`, Initial Test Vehicle).
4.  **Simulated Movement & Routing:** üöß (Current phase - Animate vehicle, integrate Mapbox Directions API for routes).
5.  **Live Tracking Integration:** (Future - Spoofing app testing, Firebase integration).
6.  **UI/UX Polish & Deployment:** (Future - Refine Admin UI, Upload UI, Sign-in, Deploy for OCR testing).

### Development Philosophy & Best Practices
*   **Simulation First:** Validate core logic with mock data before introducing external dependencies (live data, OCR).
*   **Modularity:** Encapsulate logic in services (`SimulationFromShipmentService`, `MapDirectionsService`) and dedicated components (`VehicleMarkerLayer`, `MapDirectionsLayer`).
*   **Standard Map Integration:** Leverage `react-map-gl` (`<Source>`, `<Layer>`) for adding data (like routes) to the map, aligning with React's declarative patterns. Avoid direct Mapbox GL JS plugin integration unless necessary. Use Directions API directly for route geometry.
*   **Atomic Changes:** Focus prompts and development on single, verifiable outcomes.

## üéØ Current Focus & Issues (Updated: [Date])

### üìà Current State Summary
*   **Map Initialization:** `SimulatedVehicleMap` loads correctly using `react-map-gl`.
*   **Initial Vehicle:** A test vehicle (`TEST_VEHICLE_001`) appears on load with a dedicated UI panel (Zoom/Remove buttons). **Source of this panel is confirmed to be OUTSIDE `TrackingControls.tsx` and `SimulatedVehicleMap.tsx`**. Likely rendered in the parent component using the map.
*   **Simulated Vehicle:** Clicking "Simulate Shipment Upload" correctly:
    *   Uses `SimulationFromShipmentService` to create `sim-loa123456-c96a7fd6` from `mockShipment`.
    *   Adds the vehicle to `useUnifiedVehicleStore`.
    *   Renders the vehicle's marker (emoji) via `VehicleMarkerLayer`.
    *   Fetches real-world route data via `MapDirectionsService`.
    *   Logs (`[SimulatedVehicleMap] Passing routeData...`) indicate `SimulatedVehicleMap` prepares and passes `routeData` to `MapDirectionsLayer` component instance.
*   **Missing Routes/Markers:** Despite data preparation, `<MapDirectionsLayer>` component instances are **not displaying** the route line or start/end markers for the simulated vehicle. Console logs *from within* `MapDirectionsLayer` (e.g., prop reception, GeoJSON generation) are **missing**, pointing to an internal issue within that component.
*   **Missing UI Panel:** The simulated vehicle (`sim-loa123456-c96a7fd6`) **does not** have the same UI panel (Zoom/Remove) as `TEST_VEHICLE_001` because no component currently rendered dynamically generates these panels based on store data.

### ‚ùì Key Questions & Blockers
1.  **Why are routes and start/end markers not rendering via `MapDirectionsLayer` even though `SimulatedVehicleMap` creates the component instance and passes valid `routeData` props?** (Hypothesis: Internal issue in `MapDirectionsLayer.tsx` - possibly effect dependencies, state updates, or interaction with map layers).
2.  **Where is the UI panel for `TEST_VEHICLE_001` rendered, and what logic determines its visibility?** (Hypothesis: Logic exists in the parent component rendering `SimulatedVehicleMap`, possibly tied to vehicle selection state or specific vehicle IDs/properties).

### üó∫Ô∏è Architecture Recap (Relevant Components)
- `SimulatedVehicleMap.tsx`: Main map view using `react-map-gl`. Renders layers.
- `VehicleMarkerLayer.tsx`: Renders vehicle markers (working).
- `MapDirectionsLayer.tsx`: Renders routes/start-end markers from API/prop data (intended, but failing silently).
- `useUnifiedVehicleStore.ts`: State management for vehicles (working).
- `SimulationFromShipmentService.ts`: Converts `mockShipment` to `SimulatedVehicle` (working).
- `MapDirectionsService.ts`: Fetches Mapbox route (working).
- `TrackingControls.tsx`: Renders overall stats/toggles, *not* individual vehicle panels.

### üöÄ Next Steps
1.  **(Discovery)** Locate the Uber clone reference directory in the codebase for comparison.
2.  **(Debug)** Add detailed logging inside `MapDirectionsLayer.tsx` (prop reception, `useEffect` triggers, state changes, GeoJSON processing, layer rendering attempts) to trace the failure point.
3.  **(Discovery)** Examine the parent component(s) that render `SimulatedVehicleMap` to find the source of the `TEST_VEHICLE_001` UI panel and understand its rendering logic.

## üöö Vision
Build a production-ready, simulation-first logistics system that links **document upload** to **vehicle movement** on a map ‚Äî using only mock data for now. Everything should be modular, testable, and swappable with real data later.

## ‚úÖ Sprint Objective (48h)
> Simulate a parsed shipment slip creating a vehicle that animates from pickup to dropoff on the tracking page map ‚Äî without needing to manually upload a document.

---

## ‚ùì Development Philosophy

### üîÅ Should we go through the full document upload flow?
**No ‚Äî not yet.**
- During simulation phase, we should **bypass the upload UI** for speed.
- Do **not require file uploads or API calls** ‚Äî use a **single hardcoded mock shipment object**.
- A "Simulate Upload" dev-only trigger is ideal (e.g., button, function, or mock service).

### üß† Best Practice:
- Build `SimulationFromShipmentService.ts` to handle:
  - a) Fake/mock data (current)
  - b) Real parsed document rows (later)
- This makes it swappable **without rewriting simulation logic**.

- Keep shipment transformation logic in one service (reusable later)
- Test with only 1 vehicle before scaling

## üöö Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ What's Working
- Truck emoji markers are properly displayed on the map
- Markers are animating correctly from origin to destination
- Marker selection and zooming to vehicle positions
- Vehicle data flow through unified store

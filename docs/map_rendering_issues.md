# Map Rendering Issues and Resolution

## Problem 1: Infinite Render Loop

### Symptoms
- "Maximum update depth exceeded" errors in browser console
- "Warning: The result of getServerSnapshot should be cached to avoid an infinite loop" warning
- High CPU usage
- Browser tab becoming unresponsive

### Root Cause
We identified multiple contributing factors:
1. **Zustand store snapshot caching issue**: The underlying Zustand implementation didn't properly cache its getServerSnapshot results
2. **Simulation loops**: The vehicle simulation was causing state updates during render phase
3. **Circular dependencies**: Components were updating state that triggered re-renders of themselves
4. **Uncached selectors**: Store selectors were creating new references on every render

### Solution
1. **Fixed Zustand store implementation**:
   - Created a custom wrapper around Zustand's store implementation
   - Added proper caching for both getSnapshot and getServerSnapshot functions
   - Used `useSyncExternalStore` correctly with stable getSnapshot functions

2. **Disabled simulation**:
   - Completely disabled the simulation functionality in FleetOverviewMap
   - Removed state updates during render phase
   - Ensured proper cleanup in useEffect hooks

3. **Improved component stability**:
   - Added React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders
   - Fixed dependency arrays in useEffect hooks
   - Used proper memoization for expensive calculations
   - Added cleanup for timers and event listeners

## Problem 2: Mapbox Token Detection

### Symptoms
- Map fails to load despite token being present in .env file
- Console error: "Error: Mapbox error: you may have provided an invalid Mapbox access token"

### Root Cause
1. **Environment variable access**: The Next.js environment variables might not be properly loaded
2. **Token validation**: The token might be invalidated or have incorrect permissions
3. **Environment mismatch**: Different environments might use different token configurations

### Solution
1. **Improved token detection and fallback**:
   - Added multiple environment variable checks (NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN, NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN, etc.)
   - Added a hardcoded fallback token to ensure map always loads
   - Added token validation logging for debugging

2. **Enhanced error handling**:
   - Added more detailed error logging in the MapboxMap component
   - Added token validation checks
   - Improved error UI for user feedback

## Lessons Learned

1. **State Management Patterns**:
   - Use refs to break circular dependencies
   - Ensure proper caching of selectors and snapshots
   - Avoid state updates during render phase
   - Properly memoize expensive calculations

2. **React Component Lifecycle**:
   - Use correct dependency arrays in hooks
   - Implement proper cleanup in useEffect
   - Use React.memo for expensive components
   - Keep component responsibilities focused

3. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Add fallbacks for critical environment variables
   - Implement progressive enhancement for environment-dependent features
   - Add proper error handling for environment variable issues
   - Include validation logic for environment-dependent functionality

## Next Steps

1. **Simulation Refactoring**:
   - Rebuild simulation with proper state management patterns
   - Ensure simulation only updates state during appropriate lifecycle phases
   - Add proper testing to prevent regression

2. **Environment Standardization**:
   - Standardize environment variable naming across the project
   - Add validation for required environment variables
   - Implement better default behavior when environment variables are missing

3. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Add component render counting in development
   - Implement performance monitoring to detect render loops early
   - Add error boundaries to isolate component failures

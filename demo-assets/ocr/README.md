# OCR Demo Assets

This directory contains sample images for testing the OCR functionality of the LoadUp application.

## Files

- `demo-document-1.jpg`: A sample shipping label
- `demo-document-2.jpg`: A sample bill of lading
- `demo-document-3.jpg`: A sample commercial invoice

## Usage

These files are used by the demo setup script to populate the demo environment with sample documents for OCR processing. They are copied to the appropriate location in the application's storage directory.

## Replacing Demo Files

To replace these placeholder files with actual test images:

1. Ensure the images are clear and well-lit
2. Use high-resolution images for better OCR results
3. Make sure the images contain realistic shipping information
4. Save the images in JPG format
5. Replace the files in this directory with your own test images

## Note

The files in this directory are placeholders. Before running the demo, replace them with actual test images containing shipping information that can be processed by the OCR system.

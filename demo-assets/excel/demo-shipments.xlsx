This is a placeholder for a demo shipments Excel file.

In a real implementation, this would be an actual .xlsx file with sample shipment data following this structure:
- tracking_number: Unique identifier for the shipment
- customer_name: Name of the customer
- customer_email: Email address of the customer
- description: Description of the shipment
- pickup_street: Street address for pickup
- pickup_city: City for pickup
- pickup_state: State for pickup
- pickup_zip: ZIP code for pickup
- pickup_country: Country for pickup
- pickup_contact_name: Name of the contact person at pickup location
- pickup_contact_phone: Phone number of the contact person at pickup location
- pickup_contact_email: Email of the contact person at pickup location
- delivery_street: Street address for delivery
- delivery_city: City for delivery
- delivery_state: State for delivery
- delivery_zip: ZIP code for delivery
- delivery_country: Country for delivery
- delivery_contact_name: Name of the contact person at delivery location
- delivery_contact_phone: Phone number of the contact person at delivery location
- delivery_contact_email: Email of the contact person at delivery location
- pickup_date: Date for pickup (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- delivery_date: Date for delivery (YYYY-MM-DD format)

Please replace this with a real Excel file before running the demo.

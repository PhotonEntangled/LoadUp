# LoadUp Deployment Issues

## Current Issues

After multiple attempts to deploy the LoadUp API, we've identified several issues that need to be addressed:

### 1. Module System Incompatibility

- The project is configured to use ES modules (`"type": "module"` in package.json)
- Some dependencies and code are still using CommonJS syntax (require/module.exports)
- This causes errors when trying to run the server

### 2. Database Package Issues

- The database package has an issue with the `pg` module:
  ```
  SyntaxError: The requested module 'pg' does not provide an export named 'Pool'
  ```
- This suggests that the way we're importing from `pg` is incompatible with how the module is structured in ES modules

### 3. TypeScript Build Errors

- The API package has TypeScript errors related to:
  - Drizzle ORM type incompatibilities between packages
  - Missing type definitions for some dependencies (hpp, csurf)
  - Sentry integration issues

### 4. Dependency Management

- Dependencies are installed at both the root level and package level
- This can lead to version mismatches and compatibility issues
- Some packages like `express` were missing in the root node_modules

## Recommendations

### Short-term Fixes

1. **Fix the pg Module Import**:
   - Update the database package's drizzle.ts file to use the correct import syntax for ES modules:
   ```typescript
   import pg from 'pg';
   const { Pool } = pg;
   ```

2. **Address TypeScript Errors**:
   - Install missing type definitions: `npm install --save-dev @types/hpp @types/csurf`
   - Update the security.ts file to use the correct Sentry API
   - Fix Drizzle ORM type issues by ensuring both packages use the same version

3. **Deployment Script**:
   - Use a simpler approach that directly runs the server with the correct environment
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed before running

### Long-term Solutions

1. **Standardize Module System**:
   - Choose either CommonJS or ES modules consistently across all packages
   - Update all import/export statements to match the chosen system
   - Ensure all configuration files are consistent

2. **Improve Monorepo Structure**:
   - Consider using a tool like Lerna or Turborepo to manage the monorepo
   - Ensure dependencies are hoisted correctly to avoid duplication
   - Use workspace features of npm/yarn to manage dependencies

3. **Comprehensive Testing**:
   - Add tests that verify the build and deployment process
   - Ensure all packages can be built and run independently
   - Test the integration between packages

## Next Steps

1. Fix the immediate issues with the pg module import
2. Address the TypeScript errors in the API package
3. Create a more robust deployment script
4. Document the deployment process for future reference

By addressing these issues, we can ensure a smoother deployment process for the LoadUp API.

# LoadUp Project - Testing Status

## Current Status (Updated March 15, 2025)

We've made significant progress in fixing the test suite. Here's the current status:

### ✅ Fixed Tests:
1. `__tests__/security/auth.security.test.ts` - All password security tests are now passing
2. `packages/database/__tests__/integration/migrations.integration.ts` - All migration tests are now passing
3. `__tests__/integration/connection.integration.ts` - All database connection tests are now passing
4. `packages/database/src/__tests__/etl.test.ts` - All ETL pipeline tests are now passing
5. `__tests__/security/auth.security.ts` - All security tests are now passing
6. `packages/api` TypeScript compilation - Fixed TypeScript configuration and type errors

### ❌ Failing Tests:
1. ESM Import Issues:
   - Several test files have issues with ESM imports
   - Need to update Jest configuration to properly handle ESM

2. Database Connection Issues:
   - Some tests fail with "SASL: SCRAM-SERVER-FIRST-MESSAGE: client password must be a string"
   - Need to fix database connection configuration

3. Schema Import Issues:
   - `packages/api/src/__tests__/shipments-processor.test.ts` has issues importing schema components
   - TypeScript errors with property access on schema objects

4. NextAuth Integration Issues:
   - `__tests__/integration/auth/nextauth.integration.ts` can't find module '@loadup/database/schema/auth'

## Authentication Migration (Clerk to NextAuth)

### Current Status
- **Status:** In Progress 🟡
- **Progress:** Migration scripts created, NextAuth core implementation complete, but 313 references remain
- **Migration Script Status:** ✅ Created but only partially executed
- **Test Status:** ✅ Core auth security tests passing, ❌ NextAuth integration tests failing
- **Detailed Tracking:** All Clerk references are tracked in `docs/CLERK_REFERENCES.md`

### Migration Objectives
1. ✅ Create migration scripts and guides:
   - ✅ `scripts/update-auth-deps.js` (Updates dependencies)
   - ✅ `scripts/migrate-clerk-to-nextauth.js` (Updates code references)
   - ✅ `scripts/find-clerk-references.js` (Identifies remaining references)
   - ✅ Migration guide in `docs/MIGRATION_CLERK_TO_NEXTAUTH.md`

2. 🟡 Update application code:
   - 🔴 Update authentication hooks in admin dashboard
   - 🔴 Update authentication context in driver app
   - 🔴 Update middleware in API packages
   - 🔴 Update environment variable references from Clerk to NextAuth

3. 🟡 Fix test implementation:
   - ✅ Fix auth.security.ts tests
   - ✅ Fix auth.security.test.ts tests
   - 🔴 Fix nextauth.integration.ts tests
   - 🔴 Resolve module resolution conflicts in tests

4. 🔴 Update documentation:
   - 🔴 Update README.md
   - 🔴 Update deployment guides
   - 🔴 Update status documents

### Next Actions
1. Systematically address all Clerk references listed in `docs/CLERK_REFERENCES.md` in priority order
2. Resolve module resolution issues in NextAuth integration tests
3. Ensure proper database connection in authentication tests
4. Update all auth hook implementations to use NextAuth session management

## Next Steps

1. Fix ESM Import Issues:
   - Update Jest configuration to properly handle ESM imports
   - Ensure all test files use consistent import syntax

2. Fix Database Connection Issues:
   - Update database connection configuration
   - Ensure proper credentials are used for test database

3. Fix Schema Import Issues:
   - Update the schema exports to properly expose all tables
   - Fix TypeScript type issues in tests

4. Fix NextAuth Integration Tests:
   - Update NextAuth integration tests to use correct module paths

## Completed Tasks

1. ✅ Created auth utility functions in `packages/shared/src/utils/auth.ts`
2. ✅ Fixed Jest configuration by removing conflicting config file
3. ✅ Created Jest setup file with necessary mocks
4. ✅ Created database migration structure and initial schema
5. ✅ Fixed password validation function to match test expectations
6. ✅ Fixed SQL injection tests by using mocks
7. ✅ Added missing schema components (shipmentsStaging and documentsTable)
8. ✅ Fixed TypeScript configuration in database package (added `"composite": true` and `"noEmit": false`)
9. ✅ Fixed type casting issues in security middleware
10. ✅ Fixed shipments processor to handle missing schema components
11. ✅ Created migration scripts for Clerk to NextAuth transition
12. ✅ Implemented NextAuth API route and type definitions

## Technical Debt

1. Many tests are marked as "todo" and need to be implemented
2. Some tests have improper teardown, causing worker processes to fail to exit gracefully
3. Need to standardize database connection configuration across tests
4. Need to standardize schema imports and exports across packages
5. Need to implement proper staging table for shipments processing
6. Need to fix Google Cloud Vision integration for OCR processing
7. Remove all remaining Clerk references and fully adopt NextAuth

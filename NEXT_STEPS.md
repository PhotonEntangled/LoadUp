# LoadUp Implementation: Next Steps

## Progress Summary

We've made significant progress on the LoadUp logistics platform implementation, addressing several key issues and setting up the foundation for a robust CI/CD pipeline. Here's a summary of what we've accomplished:

### ✅ Fixed Deployment Issues

1. **Drizzle ORM Type Incompatibilities**
   - Fixed the `pg` module import in `packages/database/drizzle.ts` to use the correct ES module syntax
   - Ensured proper schema imports to avoid path resolution issues

2. **Sentry Integration**
   - Updated the Sentry integration in `packages/api/src/config/security.ts` to use the correct API for version 9.5.0
   - Added proper profiling integration with `nodeProfilingIntegration`
   - Configured Express integration for automatic request handling

3. **Deployment Script**
   - Created a robust deployment script with proper error handling
   - Added support for different deployment targets (development, staging, production)
   - Implemented environment variable validation for each target
   - Added background process handling for long-running services

### ✅ CI/CD Pipeline Setup

1. **GitHub Actions Workflow**
   - Updated the CI workflow to include test coverage reporting
   - Added coverage thresholds to ensure code quality
   - Configured artifact upload/download for build outputs
   - Set up proper staging and production deployment pipelines

2. **E2E Testing**
   - Updated Playwright configuration for comprehensive browser testing
   - Fixed auth E2E tests to work with the current application
   - Added mobile viewport testing

## Next Steps

### 1. Complete Testing Infrastructure

  - Implement visual regression testing

### 2. Address Code Quality Issues

- [ ] **Path Alias Resolution**
  - Update tsconfig.json to include proper path aliases
  - Standardize import paths across the codebase
  - Create import validation scripts

- [ ] **File Extensions**
  - Standardize file extensions in imports (.js vs .ts)
  - Update ESLint configuration to enforce consistent imports
  - Create automated fix scripts

- [ ] **TypeScript Types**
  - Improve type definitions for API responses
  - Create shared type definitions for common entities
  - Add Zod validation schemas for API requests

### 3. Additional Improvements
